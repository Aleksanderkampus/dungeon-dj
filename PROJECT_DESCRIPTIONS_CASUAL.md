## Option 1: Straightforward & Inviting

# Dungeon DJ

An AI-powered platform for creating and playing tabletop RPG adventures online.

Dungeon DJ helps you run tabletop RPG sessions without the usual prep work. You create a world by choosing a genre, setting, and story background. The AI generates campaign content and narrates your adventure with voice synthesis from ElevenLabs.

**How it works:**
- Set up your campaign world through a guided form (genre, story hooks, session settings)
- Invite friends with a simple room code
- The AI acts as your game master, narrating the story and responding to player choices
- Play together from anywhere, no scheduling around a physical table

Works for both solo adventures and multiplayer sessions. Whether you're exploring a fantasy realm, investigating a noir mystery, or navigating a sci-fi universe, the platform handles the narrative heavy lifting so you can focus on the story.

# Dungeon DJ

### Tabletop RPGs, powered by AI

If you've ever wanted to play D&D but couldn't find a DM or coordinate schedules, this might be for you.

Dungeon DJ is a web app that uses AI to run tabletop RPG sessions. You describe the kind of world you want to play in, invite your friends (or play solo), and the AI handles the game master duties - including narrating with actual voice synthesis.

**What you do:**
- Pick your genre and setting (fantasy, sci-fi, horror, whatever you're into)
- Define the story background and tone
- Share a room code with friends
- Play your adventure online

**What the AI does:**
- Generates campaign content based on your world setup
- Narrates the story with professional-sounding voices (via ElevenLabs)
- Responds to player choices and keeps things moving

No prep time. No rule books to memorize. Just collaborative storytelling with an AI helping out as the game master.

**AI-facilitated tabletop RPG adventures**

Dungeon DJ is a Next.js application that makes it easier to run tabletop RPG sessions online. An AI game master generates worlds, narrates your story with voice synthesis, and adapts to your party's choices.

**The basics:**

Designed for people who love tabletop RPGs but struggle with the logistics - finding a DM, coordinating schedules, or doing hours of campaign prep. The AI won't replace a great human DM, but it makes playing more accessible.

Good for both experienced players looking for quick sessions and newcomers who want to try tabletop RPGs without the usual learning curve.
